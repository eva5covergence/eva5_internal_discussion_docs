**Only files need to update for any specific project are:**

- configs/basic_config.py - Config file
- models/Networks/*.py - mnist_specific config - architecture
- Orchestrator/*.py 
- Final Ipynb file in the root folder which triggers main.py
- Show the architecture of the network in main ipynb file


**Issues on google collab that to be fixed:**

- Unable to see Tqdm progress and other print statements on ipynb, unable capture tqdm progress in logs
- Unable to see plotted graphs
- Add more logging statements wherever it is needed
- Check any other issues while executing
- Session7 specific assignment on advanced convolutions
- Input the dataset name in orchestrator rather than in basic_config

**Later pending parts:**

- Unit tests
- Add docstrings and Sphinix Documentation 
- CICD pipelines
- Make it distributable and installable - Fix setup.py
